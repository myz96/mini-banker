The financial figures are in millions of dollars, except for per-share amounts. The table illustrates several key financial data points:\n\n- **Revenue:** Total revenue increased significantly, reaching $39,071 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $31,999 million in 2023. For the six-month period, revenue grew from $60,645 million in 2023 to $75,527 million in 2024.\n\n- **Costs and Expenses:** These are divided into cost of revenue, research and development, marketing and sales, and general and administrative expenses. Each category shows the expenditures for both quarters and six-month periods across 2023 and 2024. Notably, research and development saw a noticeable increase, reflecting Meta\u2019s investment in new technologies.\n\n- **Income from Operations:** This metric indicates the profitability from business operations before taxes and other expenses. Meta realized a significant increase, reporting $14,847 million for Q2 2024, up from $9,392 million in the previous year.\n\n- **Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net:** Indicates the income generated or expense incurred from non-operating activities, showing a turnaround from a $99 million expense in Q2 2023 to a $259 million income in Q2 2024.\n\n- **Income Before and Provision for Income Taxes:** Represents earnings before tax and the provision set aside to meet tax obligations. Both increased year-over-year for both quarterly and semi-annual periods.\n\n- **Net Income:** Meta\u2019s net income more than doubled year-over-year for the three-month period, jumping from $7,788 million in Q2 2023 to $13,465 million in Q2 2024. The six-month figures also show a significant rise.\n\n### Markdown Table\n\n```markdown\n### Meta Platforms, Inc.

The EPS values are provided for both basic and diluted formats, with calculations based on the number of weighted-average shares (basic and diluted) for each period.\n\n**Key Metrics Explained:**\n\n- **Earnings per Share (EPS):**\n  - **Basic EPS** is determined by dividing the company's net income by the simple weighted-average number of outstanding shares during the period, excluding potential dilution from conversion or option exercises.\n  - **Diluted EPS** accounts for potential dilution by including additional shares that could be created through conversions or the exercise of options.\n\n- **Weighted-Average Shares:**\n  - **Basic** indicates the average number of shares actually outstanding during the period.\n  - **Diluted** reflects the potential number of shares outstanding, assuming that options or conversion rights, such as convertible preferred stocks, were exercised.\n\nThe table provides insight into the per-share profitability of Meta Platforms, Inc., indicating changes year-over-year and underscoring the company's financial performance over the specified periods. Comparing these metrics across years shows substantial growth in both basic and diluted EPS for the periods reported, reflective of the company's financial standing and operational performance.\n\n### Table in Markdown Format\n\n```markdown\n|                       | Three Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                       | 2024  | 2023  | 2024  | 2023  |\n| Earnings per share:   |       |       |       |       |\n| Basic                 | $5.31 | $3.03 | $10.17| $5.24 |\n| Diluted               | $5.16 | $2.98 | $9.86 | $5.18 |\n|                       |       |       |       |       |\n| Weighted-average shares used to compute earnings per share: | | | |\n| Basic                 | 2,534 | 2,568 | 2,540 | 2,577 |\n| Diluted               | 2,610 | 2,612 | 2,619 | 2,604 |\n```\n\nThis markdown table effectively captures and formats the key financial metrics related to earnings per share and share count for easy readability and comprehension.",

Specifically, it outlines Meta's cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash, distributed across various categories. This table spans two time periods for fiscal years ending in June 30, 2024, and 2023, and provides these details for year-to-date figures as well. Key components include:\n\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: This represents the total amount of liquid cash and cash held by the company, ready for daily operational use. The table details that this value was $32,045 million as of June 30 for both 2024 and 2023.\n  \n- **Restricted Cash**: This category is split into two parts:\n  - **Restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets**: Represents funds that are restricted in terms of use due to being earmarked for specific purposes, such as security for certain financial obligations. Values were $100 million in 2024 and $165 million in 2023.\n  - **Restricted cash included in other assets**: This involves cash set aside for long-term obligations or investments, valued at $881 million in 2024 and $854 million in 2023.\n\n- **Total Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash**: The summation of the above items, providing a comprehensive view of all liquid assets accessible to the company. This totalled $33,026 million for both fiscal years reported on June 30.\n\nThese figures are unaudited and provide a snapshot of the company's liquidity and cash management strategy. This information helps investors and stakeholders understand how much liquidity the company has at its disposal, including what is available for immediate use and what is set aside for specific strategic purposes.\n\n### Table in Markdown Format\n\n```markdown\n| Reconciliation of Specific Assets                       | 2024 ($ millions) | 2023 ($ millions) |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Cash and Cash Equivalents**                           | 32,045            | 28,785            |\n| **Restricted Cash, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets** | 100              | 165               |\n| **Restricted Cash, included in other assets**           | 881               | 854               |\n| **Total Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash**   | 33,026            | 29,804            |\n```\n\nThis table showcases the reconciliation of cash and cash holdings for Meta Platforms, Inc. over the specified periods, providing clarity on the company's liquidity and financial preparedness.",

        "text": "### Description of the Table\n\nThe provided table details key financial metrics for Meta Platforms, Inc., highlighting both the second quarter and first half-year periods ending June 30 for the years 2023 and 2024. The table compares GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) revenue, the foreign exchange impact, and adjusted revenue figures for both total revenue and advertising revenue. It also includes year-over-year percentage changes for these metrics. Furthermore, it presents figures for operating cash flows, capital expenditures, principal lease payments, and free cash flow, comparing these results between the two years.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the table content:\n\n1. **Revenue Metrics:**\n   - **GAAP Revenue:** The unadjusted financial performance measure, which shows significant growth from 2023 to 2024 for both quarterly and half-year periods.\n   - **Foreign Exchange Effect:** Accounts for revenue changes due to fluctuations in exchange rates, allowing for the exclusion of this effect to show a direct comparison.\n   - **Revenue Excluding Foreign Exchange Effect:** Provides a more accurate view of revenue growth by excluding the foreign exchange impact.\n   - **Year-over-Year Percentage Change:** Displayed for both GAAP revenue and revenue excluding the foreign exchange effect, indicating the growth rate over the previous year. \n\n2. **Advertising Revenue:**\n   - Similar metrics as total revenue are provided specifically for advertising revenue, reflecting its importance to Meta's overall financial performance.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Metrics:**\n   - **Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:** Demonstrates the cash generated by Meta's core operations, showing an increase year-over-year.\n   - **Capital Expenditures and Principal Payments on Finance Leases:** These outflows are essential for sustaining the company's operational capabilities.\n   - **Free Cash Flow:** Calculated by subtracting capital expenditures and principal lease payments from operating cash flow, this measure indicates the cash available for further investments, debt reduction, or shareholder returns.\n\nThe table thus provides a comprehensive overview of Meta's financial performance in terms of revenue growth, the impact of foreign exchange rates, and cash flow metrics over a comparative two-year timeline.\n\n### Table in Markdown Format\n\n```markdown\n| **Metric**                                             | **Three Months Ended June 30, 2024** | **Three Months Ended June 30, 2023** | **Six Months Ended June 30, 2024** | **Six Months Ended June 30, 2023** |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **GAAP revenue**                                       | $39,071                              | $31,999                             | $75,527                           | $60,645                          |\n| **Foreign exchange effect on 2024 revenue using 2023 rates** | 371                                  |                                     | 265                               |                                  |\n| **Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect**          | $39,442                              |                                     | $75,792                           |                                  |\n| **GAAP revenue year-over-year change %**               | 22%                                  |                                     | 25%                               |                                  |\n| **Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect year-over-year change %** | 23%                                  |                                     | 25%                               |                                  |\n| **GAAP advertising revenue**                           | $38,329                              | $31,498                             | $73,965                           | $59,599                          |\n| **Foreign exchange effect on 2024 advertising revenue using 2023 rates** | 367                                  |                                     | 261                               |                                  |\n| **Advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect** | $38,696                              |                                     | $74,226                           |                                  |\n| **GAAP advertising revenue year-over-year change %**   | 22%                                  |                                     | 24%                               |                                  |\n| **Advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect year-over-year change %** | 23%                                  |                                     | 25%                               |                                  |\n| **Net cash provided by operating activities**          | $19,370                              | $17,309                             | $38,616                           | $31,307                          |\n| **Purchases of property and equipment, net**           | ($8,173)                             | ($6,134)                            | ($14,573)                         | ($12,957)                        |\n| **Principal payments on finance leases**               | ($299)                               | ($220)                              | ($614)                            | ($484)                           |\n| **Free cash flow**                                     | $10,898                              | $10,955                             | $23,429                           | $17,866                          |\n```\nThis table effectively communicates the key financial metrics and their variations, providing a snapshot of Meta's financial health over the specified period.",
